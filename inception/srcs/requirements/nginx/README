This file serves as the template for the Nginx configuration file. 
It uses environment variables (from .env) to dynamically generate the final Nginx configuration
(nginx.conf) during container startup.
The configuration ensures efficient handling of web traffic,
secure connections, and optimized performance for low traffic.

NON ROOT USER nginx: 
created by default on nginx install , but our dockerfile 
crates it if its not already present.
. user nginx;

ERROR LOG:
Level: The logging level is set to warn, path can be set to custom
but other levels include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, and emerg.
. error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;

WORKER_PROCCESSES AND CONNECTIONS:
Is set to auto to optimize based on available CPU cores.
worker_connections is set to 1024, which is typical for low traffic.

CUSTOM LOG FORMATTING
For better readability.
customized details : client IP, user, timestamp, request, status, bytes sent,
referer, user agent, and forwarded-for information.
. log_format main	'$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
					'$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
					'"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

SENDFILE:
The sendfile on directive allows efficient file transfers by reducing the number of context switches between kernel and user space.
. sendfile on;
. keepalive_timeout 65;

REDIRECTION FROM HTTP to HTTPS
We redirect any traffic from port 80 to 443, 
This ensures all traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS. We specify the paths to 
the key and certificates after this.

Configuration is dynamically generated using environment variables, the entrypoint.sh
takes this template, and creatse the .conf file from it ensuring environmnet variables are used.
